GitHub Minesweeper rules

Goal of the game: flag all mines

Available commands to add to commands.json:

    clear [field]: e.g. "clear A9", clears the selected field
    flag [field]: e.g. "flag A9", flags the selected field. Should be used when you think this field is a mine.
    unflag [field]: e.g. "unflag A9", removes a flag from the selected field. Should be used if you mistakenly flagged a field.
    end: once you flagged all mines you can end the game with this command. Tara will reveal the board and create a new PR to restart the game.
